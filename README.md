# 📦 SmartInventory Optimizer

## 🎯 Purpose
This project is built to solve one of the most critical challenges in supply chain management — **inventory stockouts and oversupply**. These problems cause either lost sales or increased holding costs, directly impacting business profitability.

The goal of this app is to use **Machine Learning (ML)** to help supply chain professionals make **data-driven inventory decisions** in real-time.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Approach

We implemented two ML-based solutions to forecast demand and recommend inventory actions:

### 1. **Time-Series Forecasting**
- **Purpose**: Predict daily demand based on historical sales data.
- **Technique**: Rule-based placeholder (e.g., average of last days; to be replaced with ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM).
- **Output**: Forecasted number of units for each SKU.

### 2. **Reinforcement Learning**
- **Purpose**: Decide the optimal action (order more, hold, or reduce stock) based on inventory dynamics.
- **Technique**: Simplified logic simulating policy-based recommendation (in real-world: Deep Q-Learning or policy gradients).
- **Output**: Action recommendation for each SKU.

## 💡 Business Question Addressed

> How can we reduce excess inventory while avoiding stockouts, using real-time data and ML?

This app answers:
- 📈 How much stock should I order tomorrow for SKU_001?
- 📉 Can I avoid stockouts for high-demand items?
- 💸 How much cost can I save by optimizing inventory levels?

## 📊 App Features

- Visual dashboard for SKU performance and predictions
- Switch between Forecasting and RL models
- Downloadable results (extendable)
- Simplified logic with room for production-grade models

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Replace rule-based models with trained ARIMA/LSTM and actual RL policy models
- Add simulation environment for inventory levels
- Connect to real-time external demand data (e.g. weather, promotions)
- Include business KPIs (service level, cost-to-serve)
